# Helper function to parse time output and calculate cputime
# Args: $1 = time log file, $2 = phase name prefix (e.g., "build" or "test")
# Sets: <prefix>_real, <prefix>_user, <prefix>_sys, <prefix>_cputime
#
# Time metrics explained:
#   Real - Wall clock time from start to finish of the call. This is all elapsed time
#          including time slices used by other processes and time the process spends
#          blocked (for example if it is waiting for I/O to complete).
#
#   User - The amount of CPU time spent in user-mode code (outside the kernel) within
#          the process. This is only actual CPU time used in executing the process.
#          Other processes and time the process spends blocked do not count towards
#          this figure.
#
#   Sys  - The amount of CPU time spent in the kernel within the process. This means
#          executing CPU time spent in system calls within the kernel, as opposed to
#          library code, which is still running in user-space. Like 'user', this is
#          only CPU time used by the process.
#
#   User+Sys (cputime) - How much actual CPU time your process used. Note that this is
#          across all CPUs, so if the process has multiple threads on a multi-processor
#          system, it could potentially exceed the wall clock time reported by 'Real'.
#          These figures include the 'User' and 'Sys' time of all child processes when
#          they could have been collected (e.g., by wait(2) or waitpid(2)).
